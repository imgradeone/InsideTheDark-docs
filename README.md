## Mirror

A mirror at [Gitee](https://gitee.com/imgradeone/InsideTheDark) in China mainland is avaliable.

## WARNING

This mod is an unofficial fan work, unaffiliated with Team Salvato.

This mod is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. It may contains lots of bugs and incompleted parts.

It is designed to be played only after the official game has been completed, and contains **SPOILERS** for the official game.

And this mod contains something **HORROR** from original DDLC games, so it is **not suitable for children or those who are easily distrubed**. More detail can be viewed at https://ddlc.moe/warning.html (with spoilers).

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

## Getting Started

### Into the code or contribute
Follow these steps to get into the code.

1. Download and install the [Ren'Py SDK version 6.99.12](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.99.12). *(NOTE: The current version of DDLC is not compatible with .rpyc files generated with other versions of the Ren'Py SDK)*
1. Clone this repo to Ren'Py SDK working directory.
1. Download the DDLC files (available for free at https://ddlc.moe or Steam) & drop the `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, and `fonts.rpa` files from it into the /game directory. (Do **not** include the `scripts.rpa` file, as this will create conflicts.)
1. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should compile & run.
1. If you want to build a release version, navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions", then check "DDLC Compatible Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.

### Just play it

I haven't decided to make a stable release, as it is still incompleted.

But there is an early access now. You can find it at [Releases page](https://github.com/imgradeone/InsideTheDark/releases).

Also, you can download it at [Gitee](https://gitee.com/imgradeone/InsideTheDark/releases) in China mainland.

For now, you'd better try this:

1. Download ZIP of the repo.
1. Copy **ALL files INSIDE THE /game FOLDER** to your DDLC original game, which can be downloaded from https://ddlc.moe .
1. And enjoy the development version.
